# Sprint-1-Project

The Jupyter Notebook is a major tool for data professionals. Notebooks made using it can include text, code, and graphs, allowing analysts to describe the flow of their research.

For your first project, you’ll be working on the platform — Jupyter Notebook is a web-based software and we have it fully integrated into our platform. Later on, we’ll guide you through the installation process, but you don’t need to worry about it yet.

This brief lesson will demonstrate the possibilities this software offers.
